# Cars4You_End2End_ML_Pipeline_Project

Contains the complete implementation of the Cars4You machine learning pipeline project. An end-to-end workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

The needed libraries are the ones used on ML classes.

To run the code it expect to have a folder structure like this (if not, change the imports and folder paths on the jupyter).
